# Renew Home Landing Page  

[Visit the Website](https://renew-home.onrender.com/)  

## Introduction  
**Renew Home** is a landing page I created as a fun project to practice my frontend and backend development skills. This project uses **Node.js** and **Express.js** to serve static files and render dynamic content using EJS templates.  

The goal was to explore the basics of web development while keeping the project simple and enjoyable.  

## Features  
- **Backend Integration**: Node.js and Express.js handle routes and serve EJS templates.  
- **Static Design**: A landing page with a clean and simple layout.  
- **Template Rendering**: EJS templating is used for reusability (partials like `header`, `footer`).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js  
  - Express.js  
- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML for structure  
  - CSS for styling  
  - JavaScript for interactivity  
- **Templating**:  
  - EJS for dynamic HTML rendering  

## Disclaimer  
- **Not Fully Responsive**: The design may not adapt perfectly to all screen sizes.  
- **For Practice Only**: This project is a learning exercise and not production-ready.  

## Note  
Through this project, I have explored:  
- Building a simple backend using Node.js and Express.js  
- Rendering dynamic pages with EJS templates  
- Combining frontend and backend technologies to create a functional web page
